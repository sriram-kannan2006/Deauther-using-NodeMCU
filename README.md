# ESP8266 WiFi Deauther and Beacon Frame Demonstration

## Description

This project demonstrates WiFi management frame analysis and beacon frame simulation using the ESP8266 NodeMCU.

The ESP8266 was configured to scan nearby networks, clone SSIDs, and broadcast multiple beacon frames. This resulted in duplicate WiFi network names appearing on nearby devices.

This project was performed for educational purposes to understand wireless communication and cybersecurity concepts.


## Hardware Used

* NodeMCU ESP8266
* USB Cable
* Laptop
* Mobile Phone

## Software Used

* Arduino IDE
* ESP8266 Deauther Firmware
* Web Browser



## Working Principle

ESP8266 scans nearby WiFi networks and captures their SSID information.

It then transmits beacon frames with the same SSID name.

Nearby devices detect these signals and display duplicate WiFi networks.



## Features

* WiFi Network Scanning
* SSID Cloning
* Beacon Frame Broadcasting
* Web-based Control Interface



## Applications

* Cybersecurity learning
* Wireless network analysis
* IoT network research


## Educational Purpose

This project is created for educational and research purposes only.
